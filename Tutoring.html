      Hi,
      I am a Student International Land- and Water Management and
      recently i have founded a small tutoring company which helps students with specific courses they struggle with.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tutoring school is focused on learning how to learn.
      <strong>The main goal</strong> of the tutor sessions is to make the student aware of the opportunities and the things they can get done.
      As experience learns that school isn't the best place to grow for studetns as the growth is <em>beperkt</em> due to strict course guidelines.
      The tutoring focusses on how to <em>take control</em> of your own learning process and <strong>leverage</strong> the skills learned for the courses to learn how to grow in areas that aren't school related.
      And are more inline with the <strong>interests</strong> of the student.
